SDG #4 Quality Education. Aim preventing cyber bullying and cyber predators
This is a keylogger that tracks all the inputs from a keyboard of a machine and sends it to an email after every minute of activity so long as it is connected to the internet
Our aim is to protect young minds from overage and malicious content and that’s where Edu-Spy comes in. This is a monitoring software that parents/guardians and the education system can utilise to ensure that children’s online presence is safe and fun.
